We have come to the end of a millennium of relentless 
and accelerating destruction of the world aroun us.
While human creativity and technology have blossomed,
we have steadily destrying the ecology  of the planet
on which we depend for our surviavl.
The sad fact is tha every day the diversity of life
on Earth gets poorer because of our overuse of resourses
and our disregard for the riches of nature.
Ecologically, our natural habits provide services without which
life on the planet would become impossible.
