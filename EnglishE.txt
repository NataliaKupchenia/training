We have come to the end of a millennium of relentless 
and accelerating destruction of the world aroun us.
While human creativity and technology have blossomed,
we have steadily destrying the ecology  of the planet
on which we depend for our surviavl.
The sad fact is tha every day the diversity of life
on Earth gets poorer because of our overuse of resourses
and our disregard for the riches of nature.
Ecologically, our natural habits provide services without which
life on the planet would become impossible.
When we tamper with the environment, it is not just nature which suffers.
Our own way of life is under threat.

Since the industrial revolution, man has burnes ever large 
quantities of fossil fuel, first coal and then oil, with the result 
that composition of the atmosphere has started to change.
Burning these fuels produces gases such as carbon dioxide, 
which act in the atmosphere like glass in a greenhouse and trap 
the hear of the sun - this is known as the greenhouse effect.
The overall global temperature has already begun to rise.
Global warming is expected to lead to extreme cganges in climate,
with more frequent floos, droughts and heat waves.
